                    As part of the Programming Techniques course, my partner and I collaborated on a pair project to
                    develop a bus ticket booking application for transportation to the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo. In this
                    project, I took charge of designing the UI of the application, supported my partner in implementing
                    the Android application using Java, and crafted the pitching script for our presentation.
